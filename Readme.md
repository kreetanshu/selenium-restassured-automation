# Selenium & Rest Assured API Sample Projects

This repository contains sample projects demonstrating automated testing using **Selenium** for UI automation and **Rest Assured** for API testing. Each project includes example test cases to help you get started with automation frameworks in Java.

---

## Selenium Sample Project

**Selenium** is a popular tool for automating web browsers. The sample project includes:

- **Setup Instructions:** How to configure Selenium WebDriver.
- **Sample Test Cases:**
    - Launching a browser and navigating to a website.
    - Performing actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, and validating page content.
    - Assertions to verify expected outcomes.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Java  
- Selenium WebDriver  
- TestNG/JUnit (for test management)

## Rest Assured API Sample Project

**Rest Assured** is a Java library for testing RESTful APIs. The sample project includes:

- **Setup Instructions:** How to add Rest Assured dependencies.
- **Sample Test Cases:**
    - Sending GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests.
    - Validating response status codes and response bodies.
    - Using JSON path for response assertions.
    - Chaining API requests (e.g., create, update, delete a resource).
    - Grouping and prioritizing tests using TestNG.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Java  
- Rest Assured  
- TestNG/JUnit
